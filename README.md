# Tequila MongoDB ODM

A simple and powerful MongoDB ODM for PHP. 
The ODM is written with slogan "Don't learn ODM, just learn MongoDB".
It means that the main goal of this ODM is to create a thin abstraction layer,
written with MongoDB in mind, **not** as MongoDB adapter for an existing ORM
(like Doctrine ODM and other popular ODMs for PHP were written).

For now this library is in active development, it's API and implementation
may and will change, so it does not ready for any use.

But you can prepare to use the new ODM by using the new driver, which this ODM is based upon:
[Tequila MongoDB PHP Lib](https://github.com/tequila/mongodb-php-lib).
